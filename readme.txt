This project focuses on creating a Java-based simulation of a neural network
and its components, with an emphasis on understanding and implementing the
underlying mechanics of artificial intelligence. At its core, the project involves
building and managing neurons, the fundamental units of a neural network, which process
input values and produce transformed outputs based on activation functions.

Key Objectives:

Neuron Representation:
Each neuron has a value (which can be updated and modified) and a name for identification.
The neuron's value is initialized randomly within a specific range and transformed using a
hyperbolic tangent function to simulate an activation process.

Modular and Scalable Design:
The project aims to implement a flexible framework where neurons can be combined into larger
networks, allowing them to work together to solve problems or adapt to dynamic conditions.

Random Initialization and Processing:
Leveraging randomness and mathematical transformations, the neurons mimic the behavior of
biological neurons, making the system more dynamic and unpredictable, similar to real-world
neural processes.

Simulation of Artificial Life:
The ultimate goal of the project is to simulate artificial creatures that inhabit a procedurally
generated map. These creatures will use neural networks to analyze their environment and develop
strategies that maximize their chances of survival. Over time, they should adapt and refine their
behavior to survive as long as possible in a challenging, ever-changing environment.

Experimentation and Learning:
The project will support testing and visualization of how neural networks operate, providing insights
into machine learning concepts like:

-Weight adjustment
-Activation functions
-Network layers
-Input-output relationships

This combination of artificial intelligence, procedural generation, and simulated evolution
creates a dynamic and interactive system. It allows for exploration of neural network applications
in autonomous decision-making and adaptive behavior, while also offering a practical introduction
to AI development and object-oriented programming in Java.
